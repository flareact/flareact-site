# Fast Refresh

Flareact _kind of_ supports React Fast Refresh. Next.js has a [nice explainer on Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) and how it works.

However, you'll find quirks with Flareact's implementation. For example, it is not resilient to syntax errors - and often times, changes will not be picked up.

_Sorry — I don't understand how a lot of it works._
